The Multivariate Exploratory Data Analysis (MEDA) Toolbox in Matlab is a set of multivariate analysis tools for the exploration of data sets. 
There are several alternative tools in the market for that purpose, both commercial and free. The PLS_Toolbox from Eigenvector Inc. 
is a very nice example. The MEDA Toolbox is not intended to replace or being a competitor of any of these toolkits. Rather, the MEDA
Toolbox is a complementary tool which includes several of my recent contributions to the field. Thus, traditional exploratory plots 
based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Partial Least Squares (PLS), such as score, loading and residual plots, are combined 
with new methods: MEDA, oMEDA and SVI plots. The latter are aimed at solving some of the limitations found in the former to
adequately extract conclusions from a data set.

The MEDA Toolbox can be used to analyze normal size data sets (several hundreds of observations times several hundreds of variables)
I am currently working with my colleagues on an extension of the toolbox for large data sets, with millions of items. 

1) The tools: 

An introduction to the exploratory tools in the MEDA toolbox can be found in:

- Loading plots, Score plots, Residual plots, Leverage plots ==> Kim H. Esbensen. Multivariate Data Analysis: in practice. Camo. ISBN: 82-993330-3-2.

- MEDA ==> Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems 103(1), 2010, pp. 8-18.  

- oMEDA ==> Journal of Chemometrics, 2011, 25 (11), pp. 592-600.

- SVI plots ==> Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems 100, 2010, pp. 48-56.


Loading and Score plots in the toolbox are 2D scatter plots in the sub-space of the PCA or PLS model. Residual plots are line/bar plots
of the squared residuals of the variables/observations. Leverage plots are line/bar plots of the squared scores of the variables/observations.

MEDA plots are map plots which contain the relationship between each pair of variables. They look similar to correlation plots, but 
they present better properties for exploration.

oMEDA plots are bar plots which compute the differences between groups of observations in the latent subspace. They are similar to 
contribution plots but again with better properties.

SVI plots are useful to understand how a variable is related to the rest of the data set. The reading of the reference above is recommended.


2) Working with the MEDA Toolbox
 
There are two ways to work with the MEDA toolbox: using the GUI (starting users) and using the commands (expert user). The GUI is seft 
explanatory. It incorporates help messages to guide its use. To launch the GUI, type "EDA" in the command line of Matlab after the 
installation as explained in the README.txt document. 

The commands provide of much more functionality. Each command includes helping information, that can be seen by typing "help <command>" 
in the command line of Matlab. Also, in the Examples directory, several EDA examples based on commands are included. It is suggested to
have a look at the examples.
